          <li data-type="method robust"> <b> Now, PhD candidate at <span name="OrangeInnov"></span>
          and <span name="LisLab"></span> </b> <p> I am currently a PhD candidate under the
          supervision of <span name="GerDam"></span>, <span name="GweLec"></span>, <span

          name="OrangeInnov"></span> </b> <p> As end-of-study internship for my schooling at <span
          name="Insa"></span>, I worked under the supervision of <span name="GerDam"></span> and
          <span name="GweLec"></span>. We developped a masked attention mecanism for T5-based
          models thanks to the SDRT (Segmented Discourse Rethorical Theory) structure of
          conversations for the question answering task in conversation. At the same time, 
          we took part in the automin 2023 challenge and presented a system capable of 
          summarizing conversations. </p> </li>

          name="IRISA"></span> </b> <p> After working with <span name="guig"></span> for a year
          (for the research program), I went on to do an internship.  We finalized our work done
          during the research program, and we have extended this work by investigating the
          plausibility of the self-attention mechanism in the natural language inference task. </p>

          with <span name="jfd"></span> on generalized linear model and more particularly the Zero
          Inflated Models. We applied these models to health care renunciation. </p> </li>

          was nominated to help students in mathematics (algebra, analysis, probability and
          differential geometry). My role was to help students prepare for exams. </p> </li>

          name="IRISA"></span> </b> <p> <span name="INSAGM"></span> allows students to be involved
          in a specialized research program. In this context, I worked with <span
          name="guig"></span>. We conducted research about the attention mecanism and the geometry
          of the embeddings produced by this mecanism, and we put forward some interesting
          links.</p> </li>

          in a specialized research program. In this context, I worked with <span
          name="guig"></span>. We conducted research about the geometry of FlauBERT and CamemBERT
          embeddings, in classification tasks, and put forward the anisotropie phenomenon in those
          type of networks. This experience introduced me to the world of deep learning research 
          and gave me a better understanding of the scientific process. </p> </li>
